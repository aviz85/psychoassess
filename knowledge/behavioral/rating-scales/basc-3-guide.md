# BASC-3 Interpretation Guide

## Overview

The Behavior Assessment System for Children, Third Edition (BASC-3) is a comprehensive measure of adaptive and problem behaviors in children and adolescents ages 2-21.

## Components

### Rating Scales
- **TRS**: Teacher Rating Scales
- **PRS**: Parent Rating Scales
- **SRP**: Self-Report of Personality (ages 6+)

### Additional Components
- Structured Developmental History (SDH)
- Student Observation System (SOS)
- Parenting Relationship Questionnaire (PRQ)

## Score Interpretation

### T-Score Ranges

**Clinical Scales** (higher = more problems):
| Range | Classification | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 70+ | Clinically Significant | High level of concern |
| 60-69 | At-Risk | Warrants attention |
| 41-59 | Average | Typical range |
| 31-40 | Low | Few behaviors endorsed |
| ≤30 | Very Low | Minimal problems |

**Adaptive Scales** (higher = better):
| Range | Classification | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| 70+ | Very High | Exceptional strength |
| 60-69 | High | Above average skills |
| 41-59 | Average | Typical range |
| 31-40 | At-Risk | Potential concern |
| ≤30 | Clinically Significant | Significant weakness |

## Scale Descriptions

### Clinical Scales

**Externalizing Problems Composite**:
- Hyperactivity
- Aggression
- Conduct Problems

**Internalizing Problems Composite**:
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Somatization

**School Problems Composite** (TRS/SRP):
- Attention Problems
- Learning Problems (TRS only)

**Behavioral Symptoms Index (BSI)**:
- Overall index of problem behaviors
- Includes: Hyperactivity, Aggression, Depression, Attention Problems, Atypicality, Withdrawal

### Adaptive Scales

**Adaptive Skills Composite**:
- Adaptability
- Social Skills
- Leadership
- Study Skills (TRS)
- Functional Communication
- Activities of Daily Living (PRS)

### Content Scales

- Anger Control
- Bullying
- Developmental Social Disorders
- Emotional Self-Control
- Executive Functioning
- Negative Emotionality
- Resiliency

## Cross-Informant Analysis

### Consistency Patterns

**Parent and Teacher Agree (both elevated)**:
- Pervasive problem across settings
- Stronger evidence for diagnosis
- May indicate trait-like pattern

**Parent Elevated, Teacher Average**:
- Home-specific problems
- Consider: Parent stress, home stressors, sibling conflict
- May indicate adjustment issues at home

**Teacher Elevated, Parent Average**:
- School-specific problems
- Consider: Academic demands, peer issues, classroom fit
- May indicate performance anxiety or school-specific LD

**Only Self-Report Elevated**:
- Internalized distress not visible to others
- Common in anxiety and depression
- Important to address even if others don't see it

## Validity Scales

### F Index (Faking Bad)
- High scores suggest possible exaggeration
- Consider response set, cry for help

### L Index (Faking Good)
- High scores suggest possible denial
- Consider social desirability

### V Index (Validity)
- High scores suggest careless responding
- May indicate reading problems

### Consistency Index
- Compares similar items
- High scores suggest inconsistent responding

### Response Pattern Index
- Detects unusual patterns
- May indicate random responding

## Clinical Applications

### ADHD Evaluation

**Expected elevations**:
- Hyperactivity (Combined/H-I type)
- Attention Problems
- Executive Functioning (content scale)

**May also see**:
- Learning Problems
- Study Skills (low)
- Adaptability (low)

### Anxiety Evaluation

**Expected elevations**:
- Anxiety
- Somatization (physical symptoms)
- Withdrawal (avoidance)

**May also see**:
- Depression (comorbid)
- Attention Problems (distracted by worry)
- School Problems (avoidance)

### Depression Evaluation

**Expected elevations**:
- Depression
- Withdrawal
- Somatization

**May also see**:
- Anxiety (comorbid)
- Attention Problems
- Social Skills (low)
- Self-Esteem (low, SRP)

### Autism Spectrum Considerations

**May see**:
- Developmental Social Disorders (content scale)
- Social Skills (low)
- Withdrawal
- Adaptability (low)
- Atypicality

### Conduct/Oppositional Concerns

**Expected elevations**:
- Conduct Problems
- Aggression
- Anger Control

**May also see**:
- Hyperactivity
- Attention Problems
- Depression (underlying)

## Interpretation Framework

### Step 1: Check Validity
- All validity indices acceptable?
- Response pattern appropriate?

### Step 2: Review Composites
- Which composites are elevated/low?
- Pattern across composites?

### Step 3: Examine Primary Scales
- Which scales drive composite elevations?
- Are there discrepancies within composites?

### Step 4: Cross-Informant Comparison
- Where do raters agree/disagree?
- What might explain differences?

### Step 5: Content Scale Review
- Do content scales clarify clinical picture?
- Any unexpected findings?

### Step 6: Item-Level Analysis
- Critical items endorsed?
- Specific behaviors of concern?

### Step 7: Integrate with Other Data
- Consistent with cognitive testing?
- Consistent with observations?
- Consistent with history?

## Report Writing Tips

### Describing Scores
- "Parent-reported concerns in the Clinically Significant range"
- "Teacher ratings fell within the At-Risk range"
- "Self-reported symptoms within normal limits"

### Addressing Discrepancies
- "The difference between parent and teacher ratings may reflect..."
- "Home and school raters agreed on..."
- "Only [informant] reported concerns, possibly indicating..."

### Connecting to Diagnosis
- "Elevations on Anxiety and Somatization scales are consistent with..."
- "The pattern of Hyperactivity and Attention Problems elevations supports..."
- "Adaptive skill weaknesses suggest the need for..."
