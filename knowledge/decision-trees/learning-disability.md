# Specific Learning Disability Decision Tree

## Overview

This decision tree guides the evaluation process for Specific Learning Disability (SLD) under IDEA and DSM-5 frameworks.

## Initial Screening Questions

### 1. Is there academic underachievement?
- **Yes** → Continue evaluation
- **No** → SLD unlikely; consider other concerns

### 2. Is the underachievement unexpected?
- Performance below expectations given:
  - Instruction quality
  - Cognitive ability
  - Effort and motivation
- **Yes** → Continue to Step 3
- **No** → Consider other factors (motivation, attendance, instruction)

## Exclusionary Factors Checklist

Before diagnosing SLD, rule out primary causes:

### Sensory Impairments
- [ ] Vision adequate (corrected if needed)?
- [ ] Hearing adequate (audiological evaluation if needed)?

### Intellectual Disability
- [ ] Cognitive ability ≥70?
- [ ] Adaptive behavior generally intact?

### Emotional Disturbance
- [ ] If emotional concerns present, is SLD the primary issue?
- [ ] Would treating emotional concerns resolve academic problems?

### Cultural/Language Factors
- [ ] Primary language considered?
- [ ] Cultural differences in learning accounted for?
- [ ] ELL status addressed appropriately?

### Environmental Factors
- [ ] Adequate instruction provided?
- [ ] Regular attendance?
- [ ] Basic needs met?

### Medical Conditions
- [ ] No medical explanation for learning difficulties?

## Pattern of Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis

### Cognitive Processing
Evaluate for specific weaknesses in:
- [ ] Phonological processing
- [ ] Orthographic processing
- [ ] Processing speed
- [ ] Working memory
- [ ] Language processing
- [ ] Visual-spatial processing

### Achievement Areas
Identify specific deficits in:
- [ ] Basic reading skills (decoding)
- [ ] Reading fluency
- [ ] Reading comprehension
- [ ] Math calculation
- [ ] Math problem-solving
- [ ] Written expression
- [ ] Spelling

## SLD Subtypes Decision Guide

### Reading Disability (Dyslexia)

**Core Features**:
- Phonological awareness deficit
- Word reading accuracy problems
- Reading fluency weakness
- Spelling difficulties

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Family history of reading difficulties
- Early language delays possible
- Adequate verbal reasoning
- Rapid naming deficits common

**Typical Profile**:
- CTOPP-2: Low phonological awareness, rapid naming
- WISC-V: Variable; PSI may be low
- Achievement: Word reading < reading comprehension
- Oral language: Often intact

**Decision**: If pattern fits → SLD in Basic Reading Skills and/or Reading Fluency

### Mathematics Disability (Dyscalculia)

**Core Features**:
- Number sense weakness
- Math fact retrieval difficulty
- Calculation errors
- Math reasoning challenges

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Difficulty learning number facts
- Struggles with math procedures
- May have working memory weakness
- May have visual-spatial weakness

**Typical Profile**:
- WISC-V: FRI or VSI may be weak; WMI may be low
- Achievement: Math calculation and/or problem-solving weak
- Often intact reading skills

**Decision**: If pattern fits → SLD in Mathematics

### Written Expression Disability

**Core Features**:
- Spelling difficulties
- Grammar/punctuation errors
- Disorganized writing
- Difficulty generating text

**Considerations**:
- Often comorbid with reading disability
- May have fine motor component
- Working memory often affected

**Typical Profile**:
- WISC-V: WMI may be low; PSI may be low
- Achievement: Written expression weak
- May have reading weakness
- Oral expression often better than written

**Decision**: If pattern fits → SLD in Written Expression

## Severity Determination

### Mild
- Some difficulties in one or two domains
- Can succeed with accommodations
- May need targeted intervention

### Moderate
- Marked difficulties
- Unlikely to develop proficiency without intensive intervention
- Requires specialized instruction

### Severe
- Severe difficulties affecting multiple skills
- Requires intensive, individualized intervention
- May need ongoing support

## Documentation Requirements

### For Diagnosis, Document:

1. **Academic underachievement**
   - Standardized achievement scores
   - Classroom performance data
   - Progress monitoring data

2. **Inadequate response to intervention**
   - Interventions attempted
   - Fidelity of implementation
   - Progress data

3. **Pattern of strengths/weaknesses**
   - Cognitive processing assessment
   - Cross-battery analysis
   - Specific skill deficits

4. **Exclusionary factors ruled out**
   - Documentation for each factor
   - Rationale for ruling out

5. **Functional impairment**
   - Impact on academic performance
   - Impact on daily functioning

## Final Decision

**SLD Confirmed if**:
- [ ] Academic underachievement documented
- [ ] Pattern of specific weakness identified
- [ ] Processing deficit connected to academic area
- [ ] Exclusionary factors ruled out
- [ ] Intervention attempted with inadequate response
- [ ] Functional impairment evident

**Report should include**:
- Specific SLD subtype (reading, math, written expression)
- Specific skills affected (decoding, fluency, comprehension, etc.)
- Severity level (mild, moderate, severe)
- Recommended interventions
