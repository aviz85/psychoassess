# ADHD Differential Diagnosis Decision Tree

## Overview

This decision tree guides the differential diagnosis process for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and helps distinguish it from other conditions with overlapping presentations.

## Initial Screening

### 1. Are attention/concentration problems reported?
- **Yes** → Continue to symptom evaluation
- **No** → ADHD unlikely; consider other concerns

### 2. Are symptoms causing functional impairment?
- Academic difficulties?
- Social problems?
- Family/home conflicts?
- **Yes** → Continue evaluation
- **No** → May not meet clinical threshold

## Symptom Evaluation

### Inattention Symptoms (check all that apply)
- [ ] Fails to give close attention to details/makes careless mistakes
- [ ] Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
- [ ] Does not seem to listen when spoken to directly
- [ ] Fails to follow through on instructions/finish tasks
- [ ] Difficulty organizing tasks and activities
- [ ] Avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort
- [ ] Loses things necessary for tasks
- [ ] Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli
- [ ] Forgetful in daily activities

**Threshold**: 6+ symptoms (children); 5+ symptoms (17+)

### Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Symptoms (check all that apply)
- [ ] Fidgets with hands/feet or squirms in seat
- [ ] Leaves seat when remaining seated expected
- [ ] Runs about or climbs in inappropriate situations
- [ ] Unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly
- [ ] "On the go" or acts as if "driven by a motor"
- [ ] Talks excessively
- [ ] Blurts out answers before questions completed
- [ ] Difficulty waiting turn
- [ ] Interrupts or intrudes on others

**Threshold**: 6+ symptoms (children); 5+ symptoms (17+)

## Onset and Duration Check

### Age of Onset
- [ ] Several symptoms present before age 12?
  - **Yes** → Continue
  - **No** → Consider anxiety, depression, trauma, acquired condition

### Duration
- [ ] Symptoms persistent for 6+ months?
  - **Yes** → Continue
  - **No** → Consider adjustment, temporary stressor

### Pervasiveness
- [ ] Symptoms present in 2+ settings (home, school, work)?
  - **Yes** → Continue
  - **No** → Consider situational factors

## Differential Diagnosis Decision Points

### ADHD vs. Anxiety

**Key Questions**:
1. What is the child distracted BY?
   - External stimuli → Favors ADHD
   - Internal worries → Favors Anxiety

2. When did symptoms start?
   - Childhood onset → Favors ADHD
   - Later onset, tied to stressor → Favors Anxiety

3. How do novel situations affect functioning?
   - Improvement (novelty engaging) → Favors ADHD
   - Worsening (fear of unknown) → Favors Anxiety

4. Physical presentation?
   - Purposeless motor activity → Favors ADHD
   - Nervous energy, tension → Favors Anxiety

**Both possible?** YES - 25-50% comorbidity rate

### ADHD vs. Depression

**Key Questions**:
1. Course of symptoms?
   - Chronic, lifelong → Favors ADHD
   - Episodic, recent change → Favors Depression

2. Interest and motivation?
   - Intact for preferred activities → Favors ADHD
   - Globally reduced (anhedonia) → Favors Depression

3. Energy level?
   - Variable/high → Favors ADHD
   - Persistently low, fatigue → Favors Depression

4. Self-esteem?
   - May be preserved or frustrated → Favors ADHD
   - Negative self-talk, worthlessness → Favors Depression

### ADHD vs. Learning Disability

**Key Questions**:
1. Pattern of attention problems?
   - Pervasive across all subjects → Favors ADHD
   - Worse in specific academic areas → Favors LD

2. What happens with support?
   - Better with structure/reminders → Favors ADHD
   - Still struggles with specific skills → Favors LD

3. Cognitive profile?
   - PSI/WMI weakness, reasoning intact → Favors ADHD
   - Specific processing deficit tied to academic area → Favors LD

4. Type of errors?
   - Careless, inconsistent → Favors ADHD
   - Consistent skill gaps → Favors LD

**Both possible?** YES - 30-50% comorbidity rate

### ADHD vs. Sleep Disorder

**Key Questions**:
1. Sleep quality and quantity?
   - Adequate sleep, still inattentive → Favors ADHD
   - Poor sleep → Evaluate sleep first

2. Daytime sleepiness?
   - Not prominent → Favors ADHD
   - Prominent drowsiness → Consider sleep issue

3. Sleep evaluation conducted?
   - [ ] Sleep history taken
   - [ ] Sleep study if indicated

**Rule**: Always evaluate sleep before diagnosing ADHD

### ADHD vs. Trauma Response

**Key Questions**:
1. Trauma history?
   - Significant trauma history → Evaluate carefully

2. Symptom relationship to trauma?
   - Symptoms predate trauma → ADHD more likely
   - Symptoms developed post-trauma → Trauma response possible

3. Nature of hypervigilance?
   - Distractible by general stimuli → Favors ADHD
   - Hypervigilant to threat cues → Favors Trauma

### ADHD vs. Autism Spectrum

**Key Questions**:
1. Social communication?
   - Socially interested but impulsive → Favors ADHD
   - Fundamental social communication deficits → Favors ASD

2. Restricted interests?
   - Normal interests, poor focus on non-preferred → Favors ADHD
   - Unusual, intense, restricted interests → Favors ASD

3. Repetitive behaviors?
   - Fidgeting without pattern → Favors ADHD
   - Stereotyped, repetitive movements → Favors ASD

**Both possible?** YES - Common comorbidity

## Presentation Determination

After confirming ADHD:

### Combined Presentation
- Meets criteria for BOTH inattention AND hyperactivity-impulsivity
- Most common in clinic-referred samples

### Predominantly Inattentive Presentation
- Meets criteria for inattention ONLY
- More common in females
- Often missed until academic demands increase

### Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation
- Meets criteria for hyperactivity-impulsivity ONLY
- Rare after early childhood
- Usually evolves to Combined

## Assessment Components Checklist

- [ ] Developmental and medical history
- [ ] Parent rating scales (Conners, BASC, Vanderbilt)
- [ ] Teacher rating scales
- [ ] Cognitive assessment (WISC-V or equivalent)
- [ ] Achievement testing (if LD suspected)
- [ ] Behavioral observations during testing
- [ ] Rule out sensory impairments
- [ ] Consider sleep evaluation
- [ ] Consider medical causes

## Final Determination

**ADHD Confirmed if**:
- [ ] Symptom threshold met (6/5+)
- [ ] Onset before age 12
- [ ] Duration 6+ months
- [ ] Present in 2+ settings
- [ ] Clear functional impairment
- [ ] Not better explained by another condition
- [ ] Exclusionary conditions ruled out or documented as comorbid

**Document**:
- Presentation type (Combined, Inattentive, Hyperactive-Impulsive)
- Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe)
- Comorbid conditions
- Recommendations
