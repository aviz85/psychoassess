# WISC-V Interpretation Guide

## Interpretation Framework

### Step 1: Evaluate FSIQ
1. Calculate FSIQ from 7 primary subtests
2. Determine 95% confidence interval
3. Determine percentile rank
4. Assign classification

**Interpretability Check**:
- If largest index difference ≤23 points → FSIQ interpretable
- If >23 points → Consider GAI or report indices separately

### Step 2: Evaluate Primary Index Scores

For each index (VCI, VSI, FRI, WMI, PSI):
1. Calculate score and CI
2. Determine percentile and classification
3. Describe what the index measures
4. Note functional implications

### Step 3: Pairwise Index Comparisons

Compare each pair of indices:
1. Calculate difference
2. Determine statistical significance (critical values)
3. Determine base rate (how common in population)
4. Interpret meaningful differences

### Step 4: Subtest-Level Analysis

Within each index:
1. Identify highest and lowest subtests
2. Determine if scatter is significant
3. Interpret meaningful patterns
4. Connect to referral questions

### Step 5: Integrate with Other Data

- Behavioral observations
- Developmental history
- Academic achievement
- Rating scale data

## Index Interpretations

### Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI)
**Measures**: Acquired knowledge, verbal reasoning, crystallized intelligence

**High VCI suggests**:
- Strong vocabulary and verbal expression
- Good abstract verbal reasoning
- Strong educational background
- Verbal learning strength

**Low VCI may indicate**:
- Language-based learning difficulties
- Limited educational opportunity
- Language disorder
- ELL considerations

### Visual Spatial Index (VSI)
**Measures**: Visual-spatial processing, constructional ability, part-whole relationships

**High VSI suggests**:
- Strong visual-spatial reasoning
- Good mental manipulation of images
- Strength in geometry, maps, spatial tasks

**Low VSI may indicate**:
- Visual-spatial processing weakness
- Nonverbal learning disability profile
- Right hemisphere concerns
- Visual-motor integration issues (if BD affected)

### Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI)
**Measures**: Inductive and deductive reasoning, novel problem-solving

**High FRI suggests**:
- Strong abstract reasoning
- Good pattern recognition
- Ability to solve new problems
- Cognitive flexibility

**Low FRI may indicate**:
- Reasoning difficulties
- May struggle with math concepts
- May need explicit instruction
- Consider impact of attention

### Working Memory Index (WMI)
**Measures**: Ability to hold and manipulate information in conscious awareness

**High WMI suggests**:
- Good mental manipulation
- Can follow multi-step directions
- Efficient processing of verbal information
- Strong attention capacity

**Low WMI may indicate**:
- Working memory weakness
- ADHD-related concerns
- Difficulty following directions
- May lose information while processing
- Anxiety may be a factor

### Processing Speed Index (PSI)
**Measures**: Speed of mental and visual-motor processing

**High PSI suggests**:
- Efficient processing
- Quick decision-making
- Good sustained attention
- Efficient work completion

**Low PSI may indicate**:
- Slow processing (not slow learning)
- ADHD concerns
- Motor difficulties (especially if CD < SS)
- Perfectionism/anxiety
- Fatigue or motivation issues
- Depression consideration

## Common Patterns

### Verbal > Nonverbal (VCI > VSI)
- Language-based learning strength
- May struggle with math, spatial tasks
- Consider NLD if significant

### Nonverbal > Verbal (VSI > VCI)
- Visual-spatial strength
- May struggle with reading, writing
- Consider language-based LD

### GAI > CPI
- Reasoning > Processing efficiency
- Classic ADHD pattern
- May show "knows more than shows"
- Consider processing support

### VCI, FRI > WMI, PSI
- Strong reasoning, weak processing
- May need extended time
- Working memory supports helpful

### Flat Profile
- Consistent functioning across domains
- FSIQ good summary
- Less need for index analysis

### Scattered Profile (>23 points)
- Uneven development
- Report indices separately
- Look for patterns within scatter

## Ancillary Indices

### General Ability Index (GAI)
- VCI + VSI + FRI subtests
- Estimates reasoning without processing demands
- Use when WMI/PSI significantly depress FSIQ

### Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI)
- WMI + PSI subtests
- Estimates processing efficiency
- GAI >> CPI suggests processing weakness

### Nonverbal Index (NVI)
- All nonverbal subtests
- Language-reduced estimate
- Use for ELL, hearing impaired, language disorders

### Quantitative Reasoning Index (QRI)
- FW + AR
- Assesses mathematical reasoning
- Useful for math concerns

### Auditory Working Memory Index (AWMI)
- DS + LN
- Auditory-specific working memory
- Compare to PS (visual WM)

## Clinical Applications

### Learning Disability Evaluation
- Look for processing strengths/weaknesses pattern
- Compare to achievement for discrepancy
- Note specific skill deficits

### ADHD Evaluation
- PSI and WMI often affected
- GAI > CPI pattern common
- Compare with behavioral ratings
- Note attention during testing

### Intellectual Disability Evaluation
- Flat, low profile expected
- Must assess adaptive behavior
- Consider developmental history

### Autism Evaluation
- Variable profiles
- May see VCI variability (IN > CO)
- PSI variable
- Not diagnostic alone
