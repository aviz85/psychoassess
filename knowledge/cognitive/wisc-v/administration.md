# WISC-V Administration Guidelines

## Overview

The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) is an individually administered clinical instrument for assessing the cognitive ability of children ages 6:0-16:11.

## Test Structure

### Primary Subtests (10)
Required for Full Scale IQ:
- **Similarities (SI)** - Verbal Comprehension
- **Vocabulary (VC)** - Verbal Comprehension
- **Block Design (BD)** - Visual Spatial
- **Visual Puzzles (VP)** - Visual Spatial
- **Matrix Reasoning (MR)** - Fluid Reasoning
- **Figure Weights (FW)** - Fluid Reasoning
- **Digit Span (DS)** - Working Memory
- **Picture Span (PS)** - Working Memory
- **Coding (CD)** - Processing Speed
- **Symbol Search (SS)** - Processing Speed

### Secondary Subtests (6)
For supplementary analysis:
- Information (IN)
- Comprehension (CO)
- Picture Concepts (PC)
- Letter-Number Sequencing (LN)
- Cancellation (CA)
- Arithmetic (AR) - for QRI

## Administration Order

### Standard Order
1. Block Design
2. Similarities
3. Matrix Reasoning
4. Digit Span
5. Coding
6. Vocabulary
7. Figure Weights
8. Visual Puzzles
9. Picture Span
10. Symbol Search

### Rationale
- Alternates verbal and nonverbal tasks
- Provides breaks from sustained effort
- Builds rapport before harder verbal items
- Ends with simpler structured tasks

## General Administration Guidelines

### Before Testing
- Review child's background information
- Prepare all materials
- Ensure proper testing environment
- Establish rapport before starting

### During Testing
- Follow standardized directions exactly
- Use proper querying procedures
- Record responses verbatim when possible
- Note behavioral observations
- Monitor for fatigue

### Timing Rules
- Start timing when instruction ends
- Stop timing when child indicates completion
- Record time in seconds
- Award time bonus points where applicable

## Subtest-Specific Guidelines

### Block Design
- Demonstrate items as specified
- Replace model designs on table correctly
- Watch for rotations (penalty varies by item)
- Record completion time

### Similarities
- Query vague responses
- Do not give credit for definitions
- Accept 2-point or 1-point responses
- Note quality of abstract reasoning

### Matrix Reasoning
- Ensure child scans all options
- Accept verbal or pointing responses
- Watch for impulsive responding
- No time limit but note if excessively slow

### Digit Span
- Read digits at 1 per second
- Do not chunk or group digits
- Administer all three conditions (Forward, Backward, Sequencing)
- Record exact responses

### Vocabulary
- Query vague responses
- Score 0, 1, or 2 based on quality
- Note expressive language difficulties
- Record verbatim for scoring questions

## Discontinue Rules

Each subtest has specific discontinue criteria:
- Typically 3 consecutive scores of 0
- Some subtests have item-specific rules
- Check manual for exact criteria

## Common Administration Errors

### Avoid
- Coaching or teaching
- Giving extra time on timed items
- Varying standardized directions
- Improper querying
- Missing discontinue points
- Not recording verbatim responses

## Special Considerations

### Suspected ADHD
- Take breaks as needed
- Redirect attention before timed tasks
- Note attention difficulties in observations
- Consider whether scores are valid

### Language Concerns
- Ensure instructions are understood
- Consider language-reduced battery
- May need interpreter (document)
- Consider nonverbal measures

### Motor Concerns
- Note any motor difficulties
- Consider impact on Block Design, Coding
- Compare motor-heavy vs. motor-light tasks
- Document in behavioral observations

### Anxiety
- Build rapport before starting
- Provide encouragement (within limits)
- Note anxiety behaviors
- Consider impact on timed tasks
