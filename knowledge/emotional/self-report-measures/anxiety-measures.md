# Anxiety Self-Report Measures Guide

## Overview

Self-report measures of anxiety provide important data about a child's internal experience. They should be integrated with parent/teacher ratings and behavioral observations.

## Common Measures

### Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-2)

**Ages**: 8-19 years

**Scales**:
- Separation Anxiety/Phobias
- GAD Index
- Social Anxiety: Total
  - Humiliation/Rejection
  - Performance Fears
- Obsessions & Compulsions
- Physical Symptoms: Total
  - Panic
  - Tense/Restless
- Harm Avoidance
- Anxiety Probability Score
- Inconsistency Index

**Interpretation**:
- T-scores: Mean=50, SD=10
- T ≥ 65: Clinically elevated
- T 60-64: High average/borderline

### Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS-2)

**Ages**: 6-19 years

**Scales**:
- Total Anxiety
- Physiological Anxiety
- Worry
- Social Anxiety
- Defensiveness
- Inconsistent Responding

**Interpretation**:
- T-scores: Mean=50, SD=10
- T ≥ 60: Elevated
- Higher Defensiveness may indicate minimization

### Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED)

**Ages**: 8-18 years

**Subscales**:
- Panic Disorder/Significant Somatic Symptoms
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- Separation Anxiety Disorder
- Social Anxiety Disorder
- Significant School Avoidance

**Cutoffs**:
- Total ≥25: May indicate anxiety disorder
- Subscale ≥7: May indicate specific anxiety type

**Advantage**: Free, well-validated

### State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC)

**Ages**: 8-14 years

**Scales**:
- State Anxiety (how they feel right now)
- Trait Anxiety (how they generally feel)

**Use**: Distinguishes temporary from chronic anxiety

## Anxiety Subtypes

- SCARED GAD subscale elevated
- Broad worry across domains

### Social Anxiety

**Characteristics**:
- Fear of negative evaluation
- Avoidance of social/performance situations
- Physical symptoms in social contexts
- May report fewer friends

**Assessment Pattern**:
- MASC-2 Social Anxiety elevated
- SCARED Social Anxiety elevated
- May be higher on Humiliation/Rejection

### Separation Anxiety

**Characteristics**:
- Fear of separation from attachment figures
- Worry about harm to parents

- SCARED Separation Anxiety elevated
- May see school avoidance items

### Panic Features

**Characteristics**:
- Sudden onset anxiety attacks
- Physical symptoms prominent
- Fear of physical symptoms
- Avoidance of triggering situations

**Assessment Pattern**:

- SCARED Panic subscale elevated
- Somatic focus in symptoms

### OCD Features

**Characteristics**:
- Intrusive thoughts (obsessions)
- Repetitive behaviors (compulsions)
- Time-consuming rituals
- Distress if rituals interrupted

**Assessment Pattern**:
- MASC-2 Obsessions & Compulsions elevated
- May need additional OCD-specific measures (CY-BOCS)

## Integration with Other Data

### Parent-Child Agreement

**High Agreement**:
- Overt, observable symptoms
- Clear impairment
- Supports diagnosis

**Child Reports More**:
- Internal symptoms not visible to parents
- Common in anxiety
- Take seriously

**Parent Reports More**:
- Possible minimization by child
- Defensive responding
- Consider validity indices

### Cognitive Testing Observations

**Consistent with Anxiety**:
- Perfectionism behaviors
- Slow processing (overchecking)
- Reassurance-seeking
- Physical tension
- Improves with rapport

### Academic Impact

- Avoidance patterns
- Test anxiety
- Homework perfectionism
- School refusal
- Selective mutism features

## Clinical Decision Guide

### When to Diagnose

**Consider anxiety disorder when**:
- Self-report elevated (T ≥ 60-65)
- Corroborated by parent/teacher
- Functional impairment evident
- Duration criteria met (typically 6+ months)
- Not better explained by another condition

### Differential Considerations

**Anxiety vs. ADHD**:
- Both affect attention
- Anxiety: distracted by worry
- ADHD: distracted by stimuli
- Can be comorbid (25-50%)

**Anxiety vs. Depression**:
- High comorbidity
- Anxiety: future-focused worry
- Depression: past-focused rumination
- Both may present together

**Anxiety vs. ASD**:
- Social anxiety common in ASD
- Consider underlying social communication
- Restricted interests may reduce anxiety
- Pattern of social difficulty differs

## Report Writing

### Describing Results

### Connecting to Function
- "These anxiety symptoms may contribute to academic avoidance"
- "Social anxiety appears to limit peer interaction"
- "Worry about performance may affect test-taking"

### Recommendations Language
