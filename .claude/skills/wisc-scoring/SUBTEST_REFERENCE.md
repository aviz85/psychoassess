# WISC-V Subtest Reference Guide

## Primary Subtests

### Verbal Comprehension

#### Similarities (SI)
**Description**: Child describes how two words representing common objects or concepts are similar.

**Measures**:
- Verbal concept formation
- Abstract reasoning
- Categorical thinking
- Crystallized intelligence

**Observations to Note**:
- Concrete vs. abstract responses
- Word-finding difficulties
- Elaboration level
- Cultural knowledge gaps

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Low scores may reflect limited verbal exposure, word retrieval issues, or concrete thinking
- High scores suggest strong verbal reasoning and vocabulary knowledge

---

#### Vocabulary (VC)
**Description**: Child provides definitions of words presented orally and visually.

**Measures**:
- Word knowledge
- Verbal concept formation
- Crystallized intelligence
- Long-term memory

**Observations to Note**:
- Quality of definitions (functional vs. categorical)
- Word-finding difficulties
- Response length
- Cultural/educational exposure

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Highly influenced by educational opportunity and language exposure
- Compare to Similarities for reasoning vs. knowledge distinction

---

### Visual Spatial

#### Block Design (BD)
**Description**: Child uses blocks to recreate a pictured design within a time limit.

**Measures**:
- Visual-spatial organization
- Visual-motor coordination
- Nonverbal reasoning
- Processing speed (bonus points)

**Observations to Note**:
- Strategy (whole vs. part approach)
- Trial and error vs. planning
- Motor coordination
- Frustration with time pressure
- Breaking configuration

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Motor demands can lower scores independent of spatial ability
- Time bonuses favor quick, confident workers
- Consider DAS-II Pattern Construction if motor concerns

---

#### Visual Puzzles (VP)
**Description**: Child views a completed puzzle and selects three pieces that reconstruct it.

**Measures**:
- Visual-spatial reasoning
- Mental rotation
- Part-whole relationships
- Without motor demands

**Observations to Note**:
- Systematic vs. random selection
- Mental manipulation ability
- Self-correction

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Purer measure of visual-spatial reasoning (no motor)
- Compare to BD: VP > BD may indicate motor weakness

---

### Fluid Reasoning

#### Matrix Reasoning (MR)
**Description**: Child views an incomplete matrix and selects the missing portion.

**Measures**:
- Fluid reasoning
- Visual processing
- Pattern recognition
- Inductive reasoning

**Observations to Note**:
- Pattern identification strategies
- Impulsive vs. reflective responding
- Response to increasing difficulty

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Relatively culture-fair measure
- Strong indicator of fluid intelligence
- May be depressed by attention difficulties

---

#### Figure Weights (FW)
**Description**: Child views a scale with missing weight(s) and selects the response that balances it.

**Measures**:
- Quantitative reasoning
- Fluid reasoning
- Analogical reasoning

**Observations to Note**:
- Understanding of balance concept
- Quantitative operations used
- Response to multi-step problems

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Includes quantitative reasoning component
- May be affected by math anxiety
- Good indicator of reasoning with numbers

---

### Working Memory

#### Digit Span (DS)
**Description**: Recall sequences of numbers in same order (Forward), reverse order (Backward), and ascending order (Sequencing).

**Measures**:
- Auditory short-term memory (Forward)
- Working memory (Backward, Sequencing)
- Mental manipulation
- Attention

**Process Scores Available**:
- DSF: Digit Span Forward
- DSB: Digit Span Backward
- DSS: Digit Span Sequencing
- LDSF: Longest Forward Span
- LDSB: Longest Backward Span
- LDSS: Longest Sequencing Span

**Observations to Note**:
- Rehearsal strategies (visible lip movement)
- Anxiety effects
- Attention lapses
- Pattern: DSF > DSB > DSS typical

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Very sensitive to attention problems
- Forward vs. Backward difference can indicate manipulation weakness
- Consider AWMI if auditory concerns

---

#### Picture Span (PS)
**Description**: View pictures on stimulus page, then identify them in order on response page.

**Measures**:
- Visual working memory
- Sequential processing
- Visual short-term memory

**Observations to Note**:
- Verbal mediation strategies
- Visual scanning patterns
- Sequential vs. spatial memory approach

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Visual counterpart to Digit Span
- Compare DS and PS to identify modality differences
- May be easier for visual learners

---

### Processing Speed

#### Coding (CD)
**Description**: Copy symbols paired with numbers using a key within time limit.

**Measures**:
- Processing speed
- Visual-motor coordination
- Short-term visual memory
- Sustained attention

**Observations to Note**:
- Pencil grip and motor control
- Strategy (checking key frequently vs. memorizing)
- Fatigue effects
- Accuracy vs. speed trade-off

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Heavily motor-dependent
- May underestimate speed in children with motor problems
- Compare to Symbol Search (less motor demands)

---

#### Symbol Search (SS)
**Description**: Scan groups of symbols and indicate whether target symbol is present.

**Measures**:
- Processing speed
- Visual scanning
- Visual discrimination
- Attention to detail

**Observations to Note**:
- Systematic scanning vs. random
- Impulsive errors
- Fatigue over time

**Clinical Considerations**:
- Less motor demand than Coding
- SS > CD may indicate motor weakness
- Sensitive to attention problems

## Secondary Subtests

### Information (IN)
General knowledge questions. Measures crystallized intelligence and long-term memory. Highly influenced by educational opportunity.

### Comprehension (CO)
Social reasoning and practical knowledge. Measures social judgment, common sense, and verbal expression.

### Picture Concepts (PC)
Select pictures that share a common characteristic. Alternative fluid reasoning measure.

### Letter-Number Sequencing (LN)
Auditory working memory with letters and numbers. Provides AWMI with Digit Span.

### Cancellation (CA)
Visual scanning speed. Alternative processing speed measure with different demands.

## Subtest Comparisons for Hypothesis Testing

| Pattern | Possible Interpretation |
|---------|------------------------|
| VCI > VSI | Verbal strength; visual-spatial weakness |
| VSI > VCI | Nonverbal strength; language-based weakness |
| BD < VP | Motor weakness affecting Block Design |
| DS < PS | Auditory WM weakness vs. visual WM |
| DSF >> DSB | Simple span intact; manipulation weakness |
| CD < SS | Motor weakness affecting Coding |
| FRI < other indices | Fluid reasoning weakness |
| PSI < other indices | Processing speed weakness |
