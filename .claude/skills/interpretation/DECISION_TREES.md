# Diagnostic Decision Trees

## Learning Disability Decision Pathway

```
START: Academic underachievement reported
│
├── Cognitive assessment completed?
│   ├── No → Administer cognitive measure
│   └── Yes ↓
│
├── Overall cognitive ability?
│   ├── < 70 → Consider Intellectual Disability pathway
│   └── ≥ 70 ↓
│
├── Achievement testing completed?
│   ├── No → Administer achievement measure
│   └── Yes ↓
│
├── Achievement significantly below cognitive ability?
│   ├── No → Consider other explanations
│   │        (motivation, attendance, instruction quality)
│   └── Yes ↓
│
├── Achievement significantly below grade level?
│   ├── No → May not meet LD criteria
│   │        (capable underachiever pattern)
│   └── Yes ↓
│
├── Pattern of strengths/weaknesses?
│   ├── No clear pattern → Gather more data
│   └── Yes, specific pattern ↓
│
├── Rule out exclusionary factors:
│   ├── Vision/hearing problems?
│   ├── Intellectual disability?
│   ├── Emotional disturbance primary?
│   ├── Cultural/language factors?
│   ├── Inadequate instruction?
│   └── Economic disadvantage primary?
│
└── If exclusionary factors ruled out:
    → SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY likely
       Specify area: Reading/Math/Written Expression
```

## Specific Reading Disability (Dyslexia) Pathway

```
START: Reading difficulties reported
│
├── Phonological processing assessed?
│   ├── No → Administer CTOPP-2 or equivalent
│   └── Yes ↓
│
├── Phonological awareness?
│   ├── Intact → Less typical dyslexia; consider
│   │           visual processing, comprehension issues
│   └── Weak ↓
│
├── Rapid naming?
│   ├── Intact → Single deficit (phonological)
│   └── Weak → Double deficit (worse prognosis)
│
├── Check other indicators:
│   ├── Family history of reading problems?
│   ├── Difficulty learning letter sounds?
│   ├── Slow reading fluency?
│   ├── Poor spelling?
│   └── Adequate listening comprehension?
│
└── If pattern consistent:
    → SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY IN READING
       (Dyslexia profile)
```

## ADHD vs. Anxiety Differential

```
START: Attention/concentration concerns
│
├── When do symptoms occur?
│   ├── Specific situations → Anxiety more likely
│   └── Pervasive/cross-situational → ADHD more likely
│
├── Onset pattern?
│   ├── Recent onset → Anxiety, depression, trauma
│   └── Lifelong/early childhood → ADHD more likely
│
├── Physical symptoms?
│   ├── Somatic complaints, muscle tension → Anxiety
│   └── Motor restlessness, fidgeting → ADHD
│
├── Nature of inattention?
│   ├── Distracted by worries → Anxiety
│   └── Distracted by external stimuli → ADHD
│
├── Test-taking behavior?
│   ├── Perfectionism, checking, slow → Anxiety
│   └── Impulsive, careless errors, fast → ADHD
│
├── Response to novelty?
│   ├── Worse performance (fear of unknown) → Anxiety
│   └── Better performance (increased interest) → ADHD
│
├── Rating scales pattern?
│   ├── Elevated anxiety/worry items → Anxiety
│   └── Elevated inattention/hyperactivity → ADHD
│
└── Consider:
    → COMORBIDITY IS COMMON
       Both conditions may be present
       Treat anxiety first if severe (may unmask ADHD)
```

## Intellectual Disability Pathway

```
START: Significantly low cognitive scores (FSIQ < 70)
│
├── Profile relatively flat?
│   ├── No → May not be ID; consider other explanations
│   └── Yes (variability < 15 points) ↓
│
├── Adaptive behavior assessed?
│   ├── No → Administer Vineland or ABAS
│   └── Yes ↓
│
├── Adaptive deficits in multiple domains?
│   ├── No → Not ID (low IQ alone insufficient)
│   │        Consider borderline, cultural factors
│   └── Yes (at least 2 domains) ↓
│
├── Onset during developmental period?
│   ├── No → Consider acquired condition
│   └── Yes (before age 18) ↓
│
├── Severity level (based on adaptive functioning):
│   ├── Mild (IQ 50-70; significant support in complex areas)
│   ├── Moderate (IQ 35-50; consistent support needed)
│   ├── Severe (IQ 20-35; extensive support all areas)
│   └── Profound (IQ < 20; pervasive support)
│
└── → INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY
       Specify severity level
       Consider genetic/medical evaluation
```

## Autism Spectrum Disorder Considerations

```
Note: WISC does not diagnose ASD; this pathway
identifies when ASD-specific assessment is warranted

START: Social/behavioral concerns noted
│
├── Social communication deficits?
│   ├── Pragmatic language problems
│   ├── Difficulty with reciprocal conversation
│   ├── Reduced sharing of interests/emotions
│   └── Difficulty with nonverbal communication
│
├── Restricted/repetitive behaviors?
│   ├── Stereotyped movements or speech
│   ├── Insistence on sameness
│   ├── Highly restricted interests
│   └── Sensory sensitivities
│
├── WISC patterns sometimes seen:
│   ├── VCI variable (Information > Comprehension)
│   ├── High Block Design
│   ├── Processing speed variable
│   └── Working memory often lower
│
├── If concerns present:
│   ├── Administer ADOS-2
│   ├── Complete ADI-R or developmental interview
│   ├── Gather school observation
│   └── Review developmental history
│
└── → REFER FOR COMPREHENSIVE ASD EVALUATION
       Multidisciplinary assessment recommended
```

## Emotional Disturbance Pathway

```
START: Emotional/behavioral concerns affecting learning
│
├── Duration and pervasiveness?
│   ├── Brief/situational → Adjustment, acute stress
│   └── Persistent (6+ months), multiple settings ↓
│
├── Primary presenting concern?
│   ├── Anxiety → Assess for anxiety disorders
│   ├── Depression → Assess for mood disorders
│   ├── Behavior → Conduct/ODD evaluation
│   └── Trauma → Assess for PTSD/trauma
│
├── Educational impact?
│   ├── Minimal → May not meet ED criteria
│   └── Significant adverse impact ↓
│
├── One or more of the following:
│   ├── Inability to learn not explained by other factors
│   ├── Inability to build/maintain relationships
│   ├── Inappropriate behavior under normal circumstances
│   ├── General pervasive mood of unhappiness/depression
│   └── Physical symptoms/fears related to school
│
└── If criteria met:
    → EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE (educational category)
       Coordinate with mental health for clinical diagnosis
```

## Differential Diagnosis Considerations

### ADHD vs. Learning Disability
| Feature | ADHD | LD |
|---------|------|-----|
| Attention | Pervasively poor | Poor when task demands are high |
| Academic | Variable, careless errors | Specific skill deficits |
| Processing speed | Often low | May be intact |
| Behavior | Often disruptive | May not be |
| Response to intervention | Structure helps | Skill instruction helps |

### Anxiety vs. Depression
| Feature | Anxiety | Depression |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Energy | Often high (nervous) | Low (fatigue) |
| Processing speed | May be slow (perfectionism) | Often slow |
| Motivation | High (wants to do well) | Low (anhedonia) |
| Physical | Tension, GI symptoms | Fatigue, sleep issues |
| Cognitive | Future-focused worry | Past-focused rumination |

### ID vs. Low Average Intelligence
| Feature | ID | Low Average/Borderline |
|---------|-----|----------------------|
| Adaptive behavior | Significantly impaired | Relative strength |
| Independence | Limited | More independent |
| Academic potential | Significant limitations | Can succeed with support |
| Profile | Flat | May have variability |
