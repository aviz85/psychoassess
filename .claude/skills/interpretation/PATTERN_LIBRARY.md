## Cognitive Profile Patterns

### Pattern 1: Verbal > Nonverbal
**Profile**: VCI >> VSI (15+ points)

**Characteristics**:

- Right hemisphere dysfunction
- Developmental Coordination Disorder

**Educational Implications**:
- May need visual supports broken into verbal steps
- Preferential seating for board visibility
- Verbal explanations for spatial concepts

### Pattern 2: Nonverbal > Verbal
**Profile**: VSI >> VCI (15+ points)

**Characteristics**:

- Weakness in language processing
- May struggle with reading, writing, verbal expression
- Often good at puzzles, building, mechanical tasks

**Associated Conditions**:
- Language-Based Learning Disability
- Specific Learning Disability in Reading
- Developmental Language Disorder
- English Language Learner considerations

**Educational Implications**:
- Visual supports and graphic organizers
- Reduce verbal load in instruction
- Allow visual/nonverbal response options
- Assess language demands of tasks

---

### Pattern 3: High GAI, Low CPI
**Profile**: GAI >> CPI (15+ points)

**Characteristics**:
- Strong reasoning abilities
- Weakness in processing efficiency
- May know material but work slowly
- Discrepancy between knowledge and output

**Associated Conditions**:
- ADHD (particularly inattentive type)
- Processing Speed Deficit
- Executive Function Disorder
- Anxiety affecting performance speed

**Educational Implications**:
- Extended time accommodations
- Reduced assignment length
- Assess knowledge separately from speed
- Break tasks into smaller chunks

---

### Pattern 4: Isolated Working Memory Weakness
**Profile**: WMI 12+ points below other indices

**Characteristics**:
- Difficulty holding information while processing
- Loses track of multi-step directions
- May forget beginning of sentence by end
- Note-taking difficulties

**Associated Conditions**:
- ADHD (working memory subtype)
- Specific Learning Disability
- Anxiety (cognitive load)
- Auditory Processing Disorder

**Educational Implications**:
- Written/visual instructions
- Chunk multi-step directions
- Allow notes and reference sheets
- Repeat important information
- Reduce cognitive load

---

### Pattern 5: Isolated Processing Speed Weakness
**Profile**: PSI 12+ points below other indices

**Characteristics**:
- Slow but accurate work
- Difficulty with timed tasks
- May not finish tests/assignments
- Processing bottleneck

**Associated Conditions**:
- ADHD
- Depression (psychomotor slowing)
- Anxiety (perfectionism)
- Motor coordination issues
- Medication effects

**Educational Implications**:
- Extended time (1.5x to 2x)
- Reduce quantity, maintain complexity
- Untimed assessments when possible
- Allow breaks for fatigue

---

### Pattern 6: Flat Low Profile
**Profile**: All indices 70-79 range

**Characteristics**:
- Globally delayed development
- Consistent low performance across domains
- Limited academic progress
- May need significant support

**Associated Conditions**:
- Borderline Intellectual Functioning
- Intellectual Disability (if <70)
- Genetic syndromes
- Environmental deprivation

**Educational Implications**:
- Individualized instruction
- Concrete, hands-on learning
- Repetition and overlearning
- Modified curriculum
- Life skills focus

---

### Pattern 7: Scattered Profile (High Variability)
**Profile**: Index scatter >23 points

**Characteristics**:
- Uneven development across domains
- FSIQ not meaningful summary
- Specific strengths and weaknesses
- Report indices separately

**Associated Conditions**:
- Specific Learning Disability
- ADHD
- Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Traumatic Brain Injury
- Can be normal variant

**Educational Implications**:
- Strength-based instruction
- Targeted intervention for weak areas
- Leverage strengths to support weaknesses
- Individualized approach

## Learning Disability Patterns

### Dyslexia Profile
- VCI often average to above
- PSI often low
- Phonological awareness weak
- Rapid naming deficits
- Working memory variable

### Dyscalculia Profile
- VSI may be weak
- FRI variable (often lower FW)
- Number sense deficits
- Working memory often affected
- VCI typically intact

### Written Expression Disorder
- Fine motor often weak (low CD)
- Working memory deficits
- Processing speed low
- VCI may be strength
- Discrepancy between verbal ability and writing output

---

## ADHD Patterns

### Predominantly Inattentive
- PSI typically lowest index
- WMI often weak
- Coding typically < Symbol Search
- Variable attention affecting all scores
- May improve with structure

### Combined Presentation
- PSI and WMI both low
- High variability within subtests
- Impulsive errors on timed tasks
- May rush through or give up
- Often intact reasoning (VCI, FRI)

### Processing Speed Subtype
- PSI << other indices
- WMI may be intact
- GAI >> CPI pattern
- "Knows more than shows"

---

## Anxiety Impact Patterns

### Performance Anxiety
- Decline on timed tasks
- Better on untimed measures
- May perform better at home
- Test-retest improvement

### Perfectionism Profile
- Very slow processing speed
- Excessive checking behaviors
- High accuracy, low output
- May be quite capable

### Avoidance Pattern
- Gives up easily on hard items
- Floor effects on difficult tasks
- Inconsistent with history
- Validity concerns

---

## Autism Spectrum Patterns

### Classic Pattern
- VCI may exceed VSI
- Strong rote memory (Information)
- Weak social reasoning (Comprehension)
- Processing speed variable
- May have splinter skills

### Profile Variability
- Profiles highly variable in ASD
- No single "autism profile"
- Look for characteristic scatter
- Compare process scores

---

## Base Rate Considerations

### Common Differences (not necessarily clinical)
- 25% have FSIQ scatter ≥ 23 points
- 14% have VCI-VSI difference ≥ 15 points
- Many patterns occur in normal population

### When to Be Concerned
- Base rate <10-15%
- Pattern converges with history
- Functional impairment present
- Multiple indicators align
