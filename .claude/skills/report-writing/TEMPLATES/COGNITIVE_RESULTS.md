### Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)

The WISC-V is an individually administered test of intellectual ability for children ages 6-16. It provides an overall measure of cognitive ability (Full Scale IQ) as well as five primary index scores that assess specific cognitive domains.

#### Primary Index Scores

| Index | Score | 95% CI | Percentile | Classification |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Verbal Comprehension (VCI) | | | | |
| Visual Spatial (VSI) | | | | |
| Fluid Reasoning (FRI) | | | | |
| Working Memory (WMI) | | | | |
| Processing Speed (PSI) | | | | |
| **Full Scale IQ (FSIQ)** | | | | |

*Note: Standard scores have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. The 95% confidence interval indicates the range in which [Name]'s true score likely falls.*

#### Subtest Scores

| Subtest | Scaled Score | Percentile |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Similarities | | |
| Vocabulary | | |
| Block Design | | |
| Visual Puzzles | | |
| Matrix Reasoning | | |
| Figure Weights | | |
| Digit Span | | |
| Picture Span | | |
| Coding | | |
| Symbol Search | | |

*Note: Scaled scores have a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 3. Scores of 8-12 are considered average.*

#### Interpretation

## Classification Reference Table

| Score Range | Classification |
|-------------|----------------|
| 130 and above | Extremely High |
| 120-129 | Very High |
| 110-119 | High Average |
| 90-109 | Average |
| 80-89 | Low Average |
| 70-79 | Borderline |
| 69 and below | Extremely Low |

*Percentile Explanation*: A percentile rank indicates the percentage of same-age peers who scored at or below this level. For example, a percentile of 75 means the child performed as well as or better than 75% of children the same age.
