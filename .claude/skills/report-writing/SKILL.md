# Report Writing Skill

## Purpose
Professional documentation of assessment findings with clear, accurate, and parent-friendly language.

See [TEMPLATES/](TEMPLATES/) for section templates.
See [PHRASE_BANK.md](PHRASE_BANK.md) for professional language options.

## Report Structure Overview

### Standard Report Sections
1. Identifying Information
2. Reason for Referral
3. Background Information
4. Behavioral Observations
5. Assessment Results
6. Integrated Summary
7. Diagnostic Impressions
8. Recommendations

## Section Guidelines

### 1. Identifying Information
```markdown
**Name**: [Full Name]
**Date of Birth**: [DOB] | **Age**: [Age at testing]
**Grade**: [Grade] | **School**: [School Name]
**Evaluation Date(s)**: [Dates]
**Evaluator**: [Name, Credentials]
**Referral Source**: [Source]
```

### 2. Reason for Referral
- State who referred and why
- List specific referral questions
- Brief context (1-2 sentences)

**Example**:
> [Name] was referred for psychoeducational evaluation by [referral source] due to concerns regarding [primary concerns]. Specifically, this evaluation was requested to [list specific questions/purposes].

### 3. Background Information

#### Subheadings to Include:
- Developmental History
- Medical History
- Educational History
- Social/Emotional History
- Family History

**Writing Tips**:
- Use past tense for historical information
- Be factual and specific
- Note sources ("Per parent report...")
- Include relevant positives (what's not a concern)
- Protect confidentiality (limit identifying details)

### 4. Behavioral Observations

**Include**:
- Physical presentation
- Rapport development
- Approach to tasks
- Attention/concentration
- Notable behaviors
- Validity statement

**Validity Statement Examples**:
> The results of this evaluation are considered to be a valid estimate of [Name]'s current cognitive and academic functioning.

> These results should be interpreted with some caution due to [factor], which may have affected performance.

### 5. Assessment Results

#### Format for Each Test:
```markdown
### [Test Name] ([Abbreviation])

The [Test Name] is a [brief description of what test measures].

| Composite/Index | Score | 95% CI | %ile | Classification |
|-----------------|-------|--------|------|----------------|
| | | | | |

[Interpretation of scores in context of referral questions]
```

**Language for Score Levels**:
- Use Wechsler classifications consistently
- Explain percentile meaning for parents
- Connect scores to functional implications

### 6. Integrated Summary

**Purpose**: Synthesize all findings into coherent narrative

**Structure**:
1. Brief restatement of referral questions
2. Overall cognitive functioning
3. Academic achievement patterns
4. Behavioral/emotional factors
5. Integration of all sources
6. How findings address referral questions

**Example Opening**:
> [Name] was referred for evaluation to address concerns about [concerns]. Overall, results indicate [brief summary of main findings].

### 7. Diagnostic Impressions

**Format**:
```markdown
Based on the results of this evaluation, [Name]'s presentation is consistent with:

- **[Diagnosis/Classification]** ([Code if applicable])
  - [Brief supporting rationale]

Conditions considered but not diagnosed:
- [Condition]: [Reason ruled out]
```

**Important**:
- Use hedging language ("consistent with," "meets criteria for")
- Explain rationale briefly
- Note what was ruled out and why
- Distinguish educational classifications from clinical diagnoses

### 8. Recommendations

**Organization**:
1. Educational Accommodations
2. Classroom Strategies
3. Intervention Recommendations
4. Home Supports
5. Further Evaluation/Referrals
6. Follow-up Timeline

**Recommendation Format**:
Each recommendation should include:
- What: Specific strategy or accommodation
- Why: Brief rationale linking to findings
- How: Implementation guidance when helpful

**Example**:
> 1. **Extended Time (1.5x)**: Given [Name]'s processing speed weakness, additional time on tests and timed assignments will allow performance that more accurately reflects knowledge. Time extensions should apply to classroom tests, standardized assessments, and timed assignments.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone
- Objective and professional
- Respectful and strength-based
- Clear and accessible to parents
- Clinically accurate

### Language
- **Use**: "results suggest," "performance indicates," "pattern consistent with"
- **Avoid**: definitive diagnostic language from test scores alone
- **Explain**: technical terms when first used
- **Vary**: sentence structure for readability

### Hedging Appropriately
- "These results suggest..."
- "Her performance is consistent with..."
- "This pattern may indicate..."
- "Based on this evaluation, it appears that..."

### Strength-Based Framing
- Lead with strengths when possible
- Frame weaknesses as "areas for growth" or "relative weaknesses"
- Highlight effort and motivation
- Note compensatory strategies observed

### Parent-Friendly Explanations

**For Percentiles**:
> A percentile rank of 75 means [Name] performed as well as or better than 75% of same-age peers.

**For Standard Scores**:
> Standard scores have an average of 100 with most people scoring between 85 and 115. Scores above 115 are considered above average, while scores below 85 are considered below average.

**For Classifications**:
> [Name]'s score of 89 falls in the Low Average range, meaning this skill is somewhat below what is typical for her age but within normal limits.
