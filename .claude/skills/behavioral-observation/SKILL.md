## Validity Considerations

### Green Flags (Valid Results Likely)
- Consistent effort throughout
- Appropriate engagement
- Clear understanding of instructions
- Adequate attention and concentration

### Yellow Flags (Interpret with Caution)
- Variable effort or attention
- Moderate fatigue
- Mild anxiety affecting some tasks
- Occasional need for encouragement

### Red Flags (Validity Concerns)
- Poor effort or motivation
- Significant fatigue or illness
- Severe anxiety or distress
- Medication timing issues
- Language/cultural barriers
- Frequent off-task behavior

## Behavioral Patterns by Condition

### ADHD-Consistent Behaviors
- Frequent fidgeting, out-of-seat behavior
- Difficulty sustaining attention on less engaging tasks
- Impulsive responding
- Variable performance (good/bad days)
- Better performance with novel or stimulating tasks

### Anxiety-Consistent Behaviors
- Excessive self-criticism
- Reassurance-seeking
- Perfectionism (erasing, checking)
- Somatic complaints
- Avoidance of challenging items
- Better performance once comfortable

### Learning Disability Indicators
- Specific task avoidance
- Compensatory strategies
- Discrepancy between effort and output
- Frustration on specific task types
- Preserved motivation despite difficulty
