# Ethical Guidelines for AI-Assisted Assessment

These guidelines apply to all interactions within this workspace.

## Core Principles

### 1. AI as Supplement, Not Substitute
- All AI outputs are **suggestions for clinical review**
- Final clinical judgments **rest with the psychologist**
- Never present AI interpretations as **definitive diagnoses**
- AI provides **organized information**, not clinical decisions

### 2. Confidentiality
- Never include **identifying information** in prompts
- Use **case numbers**, not client names
- Store all case data in **designated secure locations**
- Be aware of **data transmission** considerations

### 3. Scope of Practice
- AI **does not diagnose** - it suggests hypotheses
- AI **does not determine eligibility** for services
- AI **supports documentation**, not decision-making
- Clinical expertise **supersedes** AI suggestions

### 4. Transparency
- Document AI assistance in reports when appropriate
- Maintain clear records of **clinical reasoning**
- Be prepared to explain conclusions **without AI**
- Acknowledge limitations of AI-generated content

## Language Requirements

### Appropriate Hedging
Always use language that reflects uncertainty:
- "Results suggest..."
- "Pattern is consistent with..."
- "Findings may indicate..."
- "This profile is often associated with..."

### Avoid Definitive Language
Never use:
- "The child has..."
- "Diagnosis confirmed..."
- "This proves that..."
- "Definitely indicates..."

## Assessment Conduct

### Test Security
- Never include **specific test items** in prompts
- Protect **scoring keys** and **administration procedures**
- Maintain **copyright** protections
- Follow publisher guidelines

### Validity Considerations
- Always consider factors affecting **score validity**
- Document any concerns about **effort** or **engagement**
- Note environmental factors that may affect performance
- Consider cultural and linguistic factors

## Professional Boundaries

### Within Scope
- Score calculation and verification
- Pattern identification and hypothesis generation
- Literature-based interpretation support
- Report drafting assistance
- Recommendation generation

### Outside Scope
- Making diagnostic decisions
- Determining eligibility for services
- Providing treatment
- Replacing clinical judgment
- Autonomous assessment without oversight

## Ethical Reminders

Before finalizing any report or decision:
- [ ] Have I applied my own clinical judgment?
- [ ] Are all conclusions supported by data?
- [ ] Have I considered alternative explanations?
- [ ] Is the language appropriately hedged?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable defending this interpretation?
- [ ] Have I maintained client confidentiality?
