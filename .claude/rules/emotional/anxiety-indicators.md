# Anxiety Assessment Interpretation Rules

These rules apply when interpreting anxiety-related assessment data.

## Recognizing Anxiety in Assessment

### Behavioral Indicators During Testing
- Excessive reassurance-seeking
- Perfectionism (erasing, checking work)
- Physical tension or restlessness
- Somatic complaints (stomachache, headache)
- Avoidance of challenging items
- Slow processing due to overchecking
- Difficulty starting tasks
- Catastrophizing errors

### Score Patterns Suggesting Anxiety
- PSI depressed relative to other indices (perfectionism)
- Variable performance across sessions
- Better performance with rapport/familiarity
- Discrepancy between ability and achievement
- WMI affected by intrusive thoughts

## Anxiety vs. Other Conditions

### Anxiety vs. ADHD
| Feature | Anxiety | ADHD |
|---------|---------|------|
| Onset | Variable | Childhood |
| Attention | Distracted by worry | Distracted by stimuli |
| Activity | Nervous energy | Purposeless movement |
| Novel situations | Worse | May improve |
| Internal experience | Racing worried thoughts | Mind wanders |

### Anxiety vs. Learning Disability
| Feature | Anxiety | LD |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Pattern | Global impact | Specific skill deficit |
| Effort | High but avoidant | High but struggling |
| With support | Improves significantly | Improves but gaps remain |
| Self-talk | Negative, catastrophic | Frustrated, confused |

## Rating Scale Interpretation

### Elevated Anxiety Scales
When anxiety scales elevated:
- Consider primary vs. secondary anxiety
- Assess triggers and specificity
- Evaluate functional impairment
- Note developmental appropriateness

### Cross-Informant Patterns
- Parent > Child report: May indicate internalization
- Child > Parent report: Child awareness of internal states
- School > Home: Performance or social anxiety
- Home > School: Separation anxiety or home stressors

## Diagnostic Considerations

### GAD Indicators
- Worry across multiple domains
- Difficulty controlling worry
- Physical symptoms (tension, fatigue)
- Duration >6 months
- Functional impairment

### Social Anxiety Indicators
- Fear of social/performance situations
- Avoidance of participation
- Somatic symptoms in social contexts
- Better 1:1 than in groups

### Separation Anxiety Indicators
- School refusal patterns
- Somatic complaints before school
- Distress at separation
- Clingy behavior

### Test Anxiety Indicators
- Performance drops on formal tests
- Physical symptoms during tests
- Blanking or freezing
- Better informal performance

## Impact on Cognitive Testing

### Interpretation Cautions
When anxiety is present:
- Scores may underestimate ability
- PSI particularly affected
- WMI may be reduced
- Consider retest after treatment

### Validity Considerations
Document:
- Anxiety behaviors observed
- Impact on specific tasks
- Whether results representative
- Recommendations for future testing

## Recommendations Framework

### Immediate
- Validate the anxiety experience
- Reduce performance pressure
- Teach basic coping strategies

### School-Based
- Testing accommodations if warranted
- Check-in systems
- Counselor contact
- Classroom anxiety supports

### Clinical
- CBT referral
- Possible medication evaluation
- Parent training in anxiety management
- Coordination with school

### Monitor For
- School avoidance patterns
- Academic decline due to avoidance
- Social withdrawal
- Development of depression
