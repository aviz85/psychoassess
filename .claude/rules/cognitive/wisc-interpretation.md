# WISC-V Interpretation Rules

These rules apply when interpreting WISC-V results.

## Classification System

Use Wechsler classification terminology consistently:
- **130+**: Extremely High (Upper extreme, >98th percentile)
- **120-129**: Very High (Well above average)
- **110-119**: High Average (Above average)
- **90-109**: Average (Typical range)
- **80-89**: Low Average (Below average)
- **70-79**: Borderline (Significantly below average)
- **≤69**: Extremely Low (Lower extreme, <2nd percentile)

## Score Interpretation Hierarchy

### 1. FSIQ Interpretability
Before interpreting FSIQ, check:
- Index variability ≤23 points → FSIQ interpretable
- Index variability >23 points → Report indices separately
- Consider GAI when processing (WMI/PSI) differs from reasoning

### 2. Index-Level Analysis
For each index:
- Report score, CI, percentile, classification
- Describe what the index measures
- Connect to functional implications
- Note if significantly different from other indices

### 3. Subtest-Level Analysis
Only interpret when:
- Significant scatter within index (≥5 scaled score points)
- Pattern meaningful for case conceptualization
- Converges with other evidence

## Discrepancy Analysis

### Statistical Significance
Use appropriate critical values (p<.05):
- VCI vs VSI: 11 points
- VCI vs FRI: 11 points
- VCI vs WMI: 12 points
- VCI vs PSI: 13 points
- Other comparisons: See manual

### Base Rates
Always report base rates alongside significance:
- Significant but common (>25%) = less clinical concern
- Significant and rare (<10%) = more clinical concern

### Clinical Significance
Statistical significance ≠ clinical significance:
- Consider functional impact
- Integrate with history and observation
- Account for base rates

## Common Interpretation Cautions

### Avoid
- Over-interpreting single subtest scores
- Ignoring confidence intervals
- Treating significance as abnormality
- Making diagnoses from scores alone
- Ignoring behavioral observations

### Remember
- Scores estimate true ability with error
- Confidence intervals reflect measurement uncertainty
- Base rates ground interpretation in reality
- Context (history, behavior) is essential
- Multiple hypotheses should be considered

## Process Scores

When available, use process scores to clarify:
- DSF vs DSB vs DSS (working memory components)
- BD vs BDN (processing speed vs. spatial reasoning)
- Longest spans (capacity indicators)

## Supplementary Indices

### General Ability Index (GAI)
Use when:
- WMI or PSI significantly depresses FSIQ
- Estimating reasoning ability apart from processing
- FSIQ not representative of overall ability

### Cognitive Proficiency Index (CPI)
Use when:
- Evaluating processing efficiency
- GAI >> CPI suggests processing weakness
- ADHD or processing disorders suspected

### Nonverbal Index (NVI)
Use when:
- Language limitations present
- ELL considerations
- Hearing impairment
- Autism with language delays
