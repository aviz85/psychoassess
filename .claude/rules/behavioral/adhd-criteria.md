# ADHD Assessment Interpretation Rules

These rules apply when evaluating attention and ADHD-related concerns.

## Cognitive Profile Patterns

### Common ADHD Profiles
- PSI often weakest index
- WMI frequently affected
- GAI > CPI pattern
- Variable subtest scatter

### Processing Speed Weakness
Common in ADHD:
- Coding and Symbol Search both low
- Reflects sustained attention demands
- Not purely motor speed issue

### Working Memory Weakness
Common in ADHD:
- Digit Span particularly affected
- May show DSB < DSF pattern
- Affects academic tasks

### When Profile Doesn't Match
ADHD can exist with:
- Intact PSI and WMI
- Variable profile
- Only behavioral indicators
- Don't rule out ADHD based on cognitive profile alone

## Behavioral Observation Indicators

### During Testing
- Fidgeting, out-of-seat behavior
- Difficulty sustaining attention
- Impulsive responding
- Variable effort across tasks
- Better with novel/interesting tasks
- Frequent questions or comments
- Difficulty following multi-step directions

### Validity Considerations
- May underestimate ability on sustained tasks
- May do better in structured 1:1 setting
- Variable performance across sessions
- May show better performance than classroom

## Rating Scale Interpretation

### Multi-Informant Approach
- Parent AND teacher ratings required
- Look for cross-setting evidence
- Note: Some variation expected

### Threshold Considerations
- T-scores ≥65-70 typically significant
- Consider symptom count approach
- Look at specific item endorsements
- Consider developmental context

### Common Patterns
- Combined: Both Inattention and Hyperactivity elevated
- Inattentive: Inattention >> Hyperactivity
- Hyperactive-Impulsive: Hyperactivity >> Inattention (rare after childhood)

## Differential Diagnosis

### ADHD vs. Anxiety
| Feature | ADHD | Anxiety |
|---------|------|---------|
| Onset | Childhood | Any age |
| Setting | Pervasive | May be situational |
| Internal | Mind wanders | Mind races with worry |
| Novel tasks | Often improves | Often worsens |
| Physical | Purposeless movement | Nervous energy |

### ADHD vs. Sleep Disorder
Rule out:
- Sleep apnea
- Delayed sleep phase
- Insufficient sleep
- Restless leg syndrome

### ADHD vs. Trauma
Consider:
- Timing of symptoms
- Presence of trauma history
- Nature of attention difficulties
- Associated symptoms

### ADHD + Learning Disability
- Very common comorbidity (30-50%)
- Both may be present
- ADHD affects output more than learning
- LD shows specific skill deficits

## Diagnostic Criteria Verification

### Symptom Threshold
- 6+ symptoms for children (ages 6-16)
- 5+ symptoms for adults (17+)
- In either or both domains

### Duration/Onset
- Several symptoms before age 12
- Symptoms persistent (6+ months)

### Pervasiveness
- Evidence in 2+ settings
- School AND home preferred

### Impairment
- Clear interference with functioning
- Academic, social, or occupational

### Rule-Outs
- Not better explained by another disorder
- Not occurring only during psychotic episode
- Not due to substances or medical condition

## Subtype/Presentation Determination

### Combined Presentation
- Meets criteria for both inattention AND hyperactivity-impulsivity
- Most common in children

### Predominantly Inattentive
- Meets criteria for inattention only
- More common in females
- May be missed until academic demands increase

### Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive
- Meets criteria for H-I only
- Rare after early childhood
- Usually evolves to combined

## Recommendation Framework

### School-Based
- 504 Plan or IEP consideration
- Extended time
- Preferential seating
- Breaks
- Organizational supports
- Behavior management plans

### Home-Based
- Consistent routines
- Environmental modifications
- Organizational systems
- Homework strategies
- Parent training in ADHD management

### Clinical
- Medication evaluation (with psychiatrist/physician)
- Parent training (evidence-based)
- Skills training for older children
- Executive function coaching

### Monitor
- Academic progress
- Social functioning
- Self-esteem
- Medication effects (if applicable)
- Comorbid anxiety/depression development
